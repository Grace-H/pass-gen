* Thoughts
- How to generate syllables?
  - consonant-vowel-consonant
  - Use diphthongs, consonant blends, and digraphs
  - Use a nonsense word list
    - Would have to do math, but generating consonant-vowel-consonant
      will likely yield more possible syllables
  - Also have "number" and "symbol" syllables
- Options - Should these be minimums or exact (~==~ or ~>=~)
  - m - number of syllables
  - l - exact length of password, overrides m
  - s - number of symbols (special characters - verify commonly allows symbols)
  - n - minimum number of numbers
  - max number of characters?
- Default
  - Keep generating random syllables until reach length 12
